## SYMBOLSTORE
##
# The sadm/symbols/storesymbols.bat utility assumes that the symbols area is
# mapped to Z:\, but this is difficult or impossible to map to a folder, shared
# folder, or network host folder in Windows without having an actual real person
# do the mapping in Windows. So forget it - Windows is a waste of time. The
# storesymbols.bat here has replaced the Z:\ drive where the symbols are stored
# with a local folder on the local drive.
# It is guessed that the Dolphin infrastructure, which hosts the Windows build
# slave on the same physical machine as the build master, maps a drive to
# a share set up on the build master and this share is served over HTTPS by
# nginx from the build master host. Even if this were set up across virtual
# machines, the limitations of Windows makes this impossible to truly automate
# anyway. Since there is no need for remote access to the symbol store as any
# Windows development would be done locally, this is not a great loss.
